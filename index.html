        <p>I am a fifth grade teacher on the horizon of a new career as a web developer.  
        I love exercise, Jesus, and wine.  
        Technically not in that particular order, but each one plays a hefty role in my daily routine.
        I am the mother to a spunky black lab named Kona, and married to my best friend, Bill.

        <p>After 13 years of teaching, I decided it was time to embark on a new adventure.
            Enter Coding Boot Camp.  
            With less than 1 week of instruction under my belt, I already speak a foreign language to my friends and family.
            While sometimes I feel like the "Jimmy" in class, I am enthusiastic about my new chapter,
            and will keep you posted on my journey.
